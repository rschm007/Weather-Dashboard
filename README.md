This webapp was designed as part of the UCI Web Development Bootcamp.

This app uses jQuery, moment.js, and the openweather API to give the user a present forecast and 5-day forecast for any given city. 

The project has been deployed to GitHub pages. To use the app you can follow the deployment link or download the source files for you to use as a template.


Prerequisites
-----------------------------

To install this application you will need a text editor like Visual Studio Code. You will also need to install the Moment.js library (https://momentjs.com/) , openweather API (https://openweathermap.org/), and Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/).


Summary
-----------------------------

The user is presented with a mostly blank page containing only a search form.

Once the user enters a valid search term and presses enter (or clicks the search button), the page is populated with present forecast data and a 5-day forecast. Data is presented along with icons to make the information easily readable. The search term is also saved in a table under the search form.

If the user enters a new search term, the page is populated with weather data relevant to that city. The previous search terms persist in the table. The user has the option to click the table buttons, which will render the page with that city's forecast data.

Finally, upon refreshing the page, the page is populated with the contents of the last search query.
